# Benchmarking antimicrobial peptide (AMP) machine learning models in a genome-scanning context

This repository looks at how best to predict AMPs in genomes and how to assess prediction performance.

- [Comparison of training and test data used by AMP predictors](01_data_comparison.md) : Rmd file [01_data_comparison.Rmd](01_data_comparison.Rmd)
- [Performance metrics in an omics-scanning context](02_performance_metrics.md) : Rmd file [02_performance_metrics.Rmd](02_performance_metrics.Rmd)
- [Benchmarking AMP predictors](03_benchmarking.md) : Rmd file [03_benchmarking.Rmd](03_benchmarking.Rmd)


The files required to run the code in these Rmd files can be obtained [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/pDNN5FyDsr7sh1j) or by using the command:


```bash
wget 'https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/pDNN5FyDsr7sh1j/download' -O data.tgz
tar -zxvf data.tgz 
```
